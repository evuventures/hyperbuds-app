# spec

Read the current folder context and write a short implementation spec:

- User story + acceptance criteria
- Routes/components involved
- Data contracts (API functions, types)
- React Query hooks + query keys
- Edge cases + loading/error
- File list to change
  This command will be available in chat with /spec
