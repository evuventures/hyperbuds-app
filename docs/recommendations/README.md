# Recommendations Feature Documentation

## 📋 Overview

The Recommendations feature provides users with a "second chance" system for creators they previously passed on during the matching process. This feature helps maximize collaboration opportunities by allowing users to reconsider creators they initially rejected.

## 🎯 Business Value

- **Increased Collaboration Rate**: Users can reconsider previously passed creators
- **Better User Experience**: Reduces the feeling of "missing out" on potential matches
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Tracks user preferences and matching patterns
- **Engagement Boost**: Keeps users active on the platform

## ✨ Features Implemented

### 1. **Recommendations Display**
- Shows creators that users previously passed on
- Displays "Passed X days ago" indicator on each card
- Carousel layout with responsive design
- Dark/light mode support

### 2. **Action Buttons**
- **Give Chance**: Moves creator to matches for potential collaboration
- **Permanently Pass**: Removes creator from recommendations forever
- **Get Matches**: Triggers new matching process when no recommendations exist

### 3. **Empty State**
- Shows "No Recommendations Yet" when user hasn't passed on anyone
- Includes call-to-action "Get Matches" button
- Encourages users to start the matching process

### 4. **Visual Feedback**
- Real-time button state changes
- Loading states during API calls
- Success confirmations
- Smooth animations and transitions

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### **Component Structure**
```
src/components/dashboard/Recommendations.tsx
├── Main component with UI rendering
├── State management for liked/removed creators
├── Event handlers for user actions
└── Responsive design implementation

src/hooks/features/useRecommendations.ts
├── React Query integration
├── Mock data and API simulation
├── Mutation functions for actions
└── Error handling and loading states
```

### **Data Flow**
1. **Fetch**: Component loads recommendations from API
2. **Display**: Cards render with creator information
3. **Interact**: User clicks action buttons
4. **Update**: UI updates immediately for feedback
5. **Sync**: API calls update backend data

## 📱 User Experience Flow

### **First-Time User**
1. Sees "No Recommendations Yet" message
2. Clicks "Get Matches" to start matching
3. Passes on some creators during matching
4. Returns to dashboard to see recommendations

### **Returning User**
1. Views passed creators in recommendations
2. Clicks "Give Chance" to reconsider
3. Clicks "Permanently Pass" to remove forever
4. Uses "View All Recommendations" for full view

## 🎨 Design Specifications

### **Card Layout**
- **Height**: 420px (mobile) → 480px (tablet) → 520px (desktop)
- **Image**: 40% of card height with hover zoom effect
- **Content**: Name, role, followers, location, specialties
- **Stats**: Audience overlap and synergy score
- **Actions**: Two buttons with clear visual states

### **Responsive Breakpoints**
- **Mobile**: Single column, compact spacing
- **Tablet**: Two columns, medium spacing
- **Desktop**: Three columns, generous spacing

### **Color Scheme**
- **Primary**: Orange/red gradient for "Give Chance"
- **Secondary**: Gray/black for "Permanently Pass"
- **Success**: Green for completed actions
- **Warning**: Red for removal actions

## 🔧 API Integration Ready

### **Current State: Mock Data**
The feature currently uses mock data for development and testing:
- 5 sample creators with realistic data
- Simulated API delays (1s for fetch, 500ms for actions)
- Console logging for debugging

### **Production API Endpoints Needed**
```typescript
// Get recommendations
GET /api/recommendations
Response: {
  recommendations: RecommendationCard[],
  total: number,
  hasMore: boolean
}

// Give another chance
POST /api/recommendations/give-chance
Body: { creatorId: number }
Response: { success: boolean, creatorId: number }

// Permanently pass
POST /api/recommendations/permanently-pass
Body: { creatorId: number }
Response: { success: boolean, creatorId: number }
```

### **Data Model**
```typescript
interface RecommendationCard {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  role: string;
  followers: string;
  overlap: string;
  synergy: string;
  img: string;
  location: string;
  responseTime: string;
  collaborationRate: string;
  rizzScore: number;
  verified: boolean;
  online: boolean;
  specialties: string[];
  recentWork: string;
  passedAt: string; // Key field showing when they were passed
}
```

## 🚀 Implementation Status

- [x] Responsive design for all screen sizes
- [x] Dark/light mode support
- [x] Mock data integration
- [x] Button actions and state management
- [x] Loading and error states
- [x] Empty state handling
- [x] Visual feedback and animations

- [x] Performance optimizations

### **🔄 Ready for Production**
- [ ] Replace mock data with real API calls
- [ ] Add error handling for API failures
- [ ] Implement toast notifications
- [ ] Add analytics tracking
- [ ] Test with real user data

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### **Optimizations Implemented**
- **React.memo**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders
- **useCallback**: Memoizes event handlers
- **Lazy loading**: Images load on demand
- **Efficient filtering**: Removes processed creators from view
- **Debounced actions**: Prevents multiple rapid clicks

### **Bundle Impact**
- **Component size**: ~15KB gzipped
- **Dependencies**: Swiper.js, Framer Motion, React Query
- **Images**: Optimized with Next.js Image component

## 🧪 Testing Strategy
