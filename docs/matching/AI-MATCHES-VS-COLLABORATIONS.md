## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Shared Components
Both pages use:
- `DashboardLayout` - Main layout wrapper
- `MatchHistoryGallery` - Display matches in grid
- `ProfileModal` - View detailed profile information
- `useMatchHistory` hook - Fetch match data from API
- Same loading and error states

### Component Files
```
src/app/ai-matches/page.tsx        # AI Matches page
src/app/collaborations/page.tsx    # Collaborations page
src/components/matching/MatchHistoryGallery.tsx  # Shared gallery
src/components/matching/ProfileModal.tsx         # Shared modal
src/hooks/features/useMatching.ts                # API hook
```

### Data Flow
```typescript
// AI Matches - Get ALL matches
const { data } = useMatchHistory({
  status: 'all',
  sortBy: 'compatibility',
  sortOrder: 'desc'
});

// Collaborations - Get MUTUAL matches only
const { data } = useMatchHistory({
  status: 'mutual',
  sortBy: 'date',
  sortOrder: 'desc'
});
```

## üé® Design Patterns

### Color Schemes

**AI Matches**
- Primary gradient: Purple to Pink (`from-purple-500 to-pink-500`)
- Icon: Heart (romantic/discovery theme)
- Accent: Yellow sparkles for AI magic

**Collaborations**
- Primary gradient: Purple to Pink (`from-purple-500 to-pink-500`)
- Icon: Users (team/collaboration theme)
- Multiple gradients for stat cards (Purple/Pink, Blue/Cyan, Green/Emerald)

### Dark Mode Support
Both pages fully support dark mode with:
- `dark:` Tailwind variants
- Adjusted opacity for backgrounds
- Proper contrast for text and borders
- Gradient adjustments for visibility

---

## üì± Responsive Design

Both pages are fully responsive with:
- Mobile-first approach
- Stacked layouts on small screens
- Grid layouts on larger screens (md:grid-cols-2, md:grid-cols-3)
- Adjusted padding and spacing
- Touch-friendly buttons and cards

### Breakpoints
- Mobile: Full width, single column
- Tablet (md): 2-column grids
- Desktop (lg): 3-column grids, larger spacing

---

## üîÑ State Management

### Local State
Both pages maintain:
```typescript
const [selectedProfile, setSelectedProfile] = useState<CreatorProfile | null>(null);
const [isProfileModalOpen, setIsProfileModalOpen] = useState(false);
const [likedMatches, setLikedMatches] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
const [isMounted, setIsMounted] = useState(false);
```

### Client-Side Rendering
Both pages use client-side only rendering to prevent hydration issues:
```typescript
React.useEffect(() => {
  setIsMounted(true);
}, []);

if (!isMounted) {
  return <LoadingState />;
}
```

## üìù Notes

- Both pages use the same `useMatchHistory` hook with different parameters
- The key differentiator is the `status` parameter: `'all'` vs `'mutual'`
- Both pages share the same gallery and modal components for consistency
- Navigation between pages is seamless through the router
- Empty states guide users to take action (complete profile, start matching)
