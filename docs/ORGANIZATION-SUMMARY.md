## 🔄 **Files Moved**

### Payment System (7 files)
- `payment-backend-api-specification.md` → `payments/api-specification.md`
- `payment-integration-frontend-implementation.md` → `payments/frontend-implementation.md`
- `payment-integration-summary.md` → `payments/integration-summary.md`
- `payment-integration-usage-examples.md` → `payments/usage-examples.md`
- `payment-integration-backend-requirements.md` → `payments/backend-requirements.md`
- `stripe-setup-guide.md` → `payments/stripe-setup-guide.md`
- `payment-integration-final-review.md` → `payments/final-review.md`

### Messaging System (2 files)
- `messaging-backend-api-specification.md` → `messaging/api-specification.md`
- `messaging-implementation-summary.md` → `messaging/implementation-summary.md`

### General Documentation (4 files)
- `frontend-architecture.md` → `general/architecture.md`
- `component-library.md` → `general/component-library.md`
- `state-management.md` → `general/state-management.md`
- `development-setup.md` → `general/development-setup.md`
- `deployment.md` → `general/deployment.md`

## ✅ **Benefits of New Structure**

### 1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
- **Payments**: All payment-related documentation in one place
- **Messaging**: All messaging-related documentation in one place
- **General**: Architecture, setup, and general guidelines

### 2. **Team-Specific Navigation**
- **Backend Team**: Can focus on `api-specification.md` files
- **Frontend Team**: Can focus on `frontend-implementation.md` and `usage-examples.md`
- **DevOps Team**: Can focus on `deployment.md` and `stripe-setup-guide.md`

### 3. **Professional Organization**
- Each folder has its own README for quick navigation
- Consistent naming conventions
- Logical grouping of related files

### 4. **Easy Maintenance**
- New documentation can be added to the appropriate folder
- Clear structure makes it easy to find and update files
- Each team knows exactly where to look for their documentation
